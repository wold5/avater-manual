Manual for AVATeR, the [Annotation Viewer And Tools for (PocketBook) e-Readers](https://www.syncoda.nl/software/avater/).

Written in Markdown. Converted to HTML for inclusion in the application and [display on the website](https://www.syncoda.nl/software/avater/manuals/).

## Pandoc notes
- add `\` to the end of images, to prevent conversion to `<figure>` which aren't well supported by Qt5 HTML viewer
